## Project Description
*altTools*  is Python Package created to contain a collection of *unrealated* and *useful* functions for a coder's convienience when needed. Some tools are pretty miscellaneous extras that do things like Ceasar Cipher encryption and some tools have more useful applications like randomly shuffling two iterable objects in the same order (not yet implemented). A lot of these functions and tools *already exist* and are known in the Python community elsewhere, but now you can find most of them in one place!

### Usage

Module Class-> `altTools()`

`write(value, pause=0.06, newline=True)` Prints out values to the stream and pauses shortly between each value to create a typewriter effect. ***Result may vary depending on your coding enviornment!**

`clr_input(prompt)` Works like a regular input statement, but clears the prompt and input value after a newline key is pressed.

`encrypt(value, shift)` Returns a Ceasar Cipher encrypted version of a string corresponding to the shift prameter value.
