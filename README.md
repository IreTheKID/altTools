## Project Description
---
*altTools*  is Python Package I created to contain a bunch of *unrealated* and *useful* functions for a coder's convienience when in a pinch. Some tools are pretty miscellaneous extras that do things like Ceasar Cipher encryption and some tools have more useful functions like randomly sorting two iterable objects the same way. A lot of these functions and tools *already exist* in the Python community elsewhere, but now you can find most of them in one place! **I'm not a professional Python coder, nor am I exceptional at Python coding and its conventions. Some functions may not work as intended.**

Module Class `altTools()`

`write(value, pause=0.06, newline=True)` Prints out values to the stream and pauses shortly between each value to create a typewriter effect. ***Limitations in coding enviorments can lead to inconsistencies**

`clr_input(prompt)` Works like a regular input statement, but clears the prompt and input value after a newline key is pressed.

`encrypt(value, shift)` Returns a Ceasar Cipher encrypted version of a string corresponding to the shift prameter value.
